This repository contains a task driver for [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) to run web-applications in IIS on Windows machines. Unlike most other Nomad task drivers, this one is written in the C# language using ASP.NET 7.
It uses the *Microsoft.Web.Administration*-API to communicate with IIS.
Feel free to use it as-is or as a reference implementation for your own C#-based Nomad-plugins.

      resources {
        cpu    = 100
        memory = 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üåé Environment Variables

All System Environment Variables available to the Nomad Client will be applied to the Application Pool.
You can supply additional ones by using the [`env` Block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/job-specification/env) in the `task` stanza.

## ‚ú® Supported Signals

The Nomad IIS driver supports the following signals:

| Signal | Description |
|---|---|
| `SIGHUP` or `RECYCLE` | Recycles the Application Pool |

To send a *RECYCLE* signal, run:

```
nomad alloc signal -s RECYCLE <allocation> <task>
```

Details about the command can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/commands/alloc/signal).

## üõ° Filesystem Isolation

Because there is no `chroot` on Windows, filesystem isolation is only handled via permissions.
For every AppPool, IIS creates a dedicated AppPool Service Account which is only allowed to access it's own directories. See commits of [GH-5](https://github.com/sevensolutions/nomad-iis/issues/5) for details.

Given a job spec with two tasks, the following table depicts the permissions for each AppPool *task1* and *task2* inside the [allocation directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad/docs/concepts/filesystem).

| Directory | Access Level |
|---|---|
| `/alloc` | No Access |
| `/alloc/data` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/alloc/logs` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/alloc/tmp` | Full Access for *task1* and *task2* |
| `/task1/local` | Full Access for *task1* |
| `/task1/private` | No Access |
| `/task1/secrets` | Read Only for *task1*, No Access for *task2*, no file listing |
| `/task1/tmp` | Full Access for *task1* |
| `/task2/local` | Full Access for *task2* |
| `/task2/private` | No Access |
| `/task2/secrets` | Read Only for *task2*, No Access for *task1*, no file listing |
| `/task2/tmp` | Full Access for *task2* |

## üåê Using an existing Website

By specifying a *target_website* in the task configuration you can re-use an existing website managed outside of nomad.
In this case the driver will not create a new website but instead use the existing one where it provisions the virtual applications only.

Note that there're a few restrictions when using a target_website:

- The feature [needs to be enabled](#-driver-configuration).
- Re-using an existing website managed by nomad (owned by a different job or task), is not allowed.
- Bindings and other website-related configuration will have no effect.
- You need to make sure you constrain your jobs to nodes having this target_website available, otherwise the job will fail.
- You cannot create a root-application when using a target_website.

## üõ† How to Compile

Run the setup command to download the nomad binary.

```
.\setup.ps1
```

Build the project by running the following command:

```
cd src
dotnet build
```

Of course you can also compile with Visual Studio :)

## üêõ How to Debug locally

There is a launch-profile to run nomad in dev-mode which automatically loads the driver plugin.
Open Visual Studio, select the *Nomad* launch profile and press *F5*.

Note: To debug the driver itself, you need to attach the debugger to the nomad_iis.exe process manually.

## üéÅ How to build Release version

Run the *Release.pubxml* publish profile from Visual Studio. This will create a single binary exe called *nomad_iis.exe*.
